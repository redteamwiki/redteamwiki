# Mimikatz::Event

`event::` module documentation

The `event::` module groups commands that interact with the Windows Event Log
service. Each command is summarized below with its purpose, available flags,
and guidance on when and why to use them.

## Command summary

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`event::drop`](#eventdrop) | Apply an in-memory patch to the Event Log service so that new events are silently discarded. |
| [`event::clear`](#eventclear) | Clear the contents of a specified Windows event log channel. |

---

## `event::drop`

**Purpose:** Temporarily patch the running Event Log service process so that it
returns immediately when attempting to persist new events. This prevents the
system from recording subsequent log entries while the patch is in place.

**Syntax:**

```
mimikatz # event::drop
```

**Flags:** None.

**How it works:**

* The command enumerates architecture- and build-specific byte patterns and
  corresponding patches for the Event Log service implementation of
  `Channel::ActualProcessEvent` (or `PerformWriteRequest` on older systems).
  These patterns cover numerous Windows builds and architectures so that the
  proper instructions can be located reliably.【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L17-L74】
* Once the correct patch is identified for the host build, `event::drop` calls
  `kull_m_patch_genericProcessOrServiceFromBuild` to apply the patch inside the
  `EventLog` service process (loading either `eventlog.dll` or `wevtsvc.dll`
  depending on the OS version).【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L77-L80】

**Why use it:** This is useful during offensive operations when you need to
prevent Windows from recording new security or application events that could
expose your activities. Because the patch intercepts event processing at the
service level, any component that relies on the standard logging pipeline will
quietly fail to persist events until the service is restarted or the system is
rebooted, reverting the patch.

**Caution:** The technique is experimental and invasive. Patching core services
can destabilize the system or trigger security controls. Always test in a lab
and be prepared to restart the Event Log service to restore normal logging.

## `event::clear`

**Purpose:** Clear all records from a specific Windows event log channel and
report the number of entries before and after the operation.【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L83-L103】

**Syntax:**

```
mimikatz # event::clear [/log:<ChannelName>]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description | Why use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/log:<ChannelName>` | Specifies which event log channel to open and clear. If omitted, the command defaults to the `Security` log.【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L88-L99】 | Targeting the right log ensures you only purge the records relevant to your operation. Overwriting the default prevents accidental clearing of the high-value `Security` log when you intend to manipulate another channel. |

**How it works:**

1. Resolves the target log channel from the `/log` argument, defaulting to
   `Security` when the flag is not provided.【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L88-L90】
2. Opens the event log, counts the current number of records, and displays it to
   the console.【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L90-L94】
3. Calls `ClearEventLog` to wipe the log and reports success or the encountered
   error code.【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L95-L97】
4. Queries the record count again to confirm that the log is empty (or show any
   remaining events, such as those generated during the clearing process).【F:mimikatz/modules/kuhl_m_event.c†L97-L99】

**Why use it:** Clearing an event log can remove forensic evidence of your
activities, especially when done immediately after executing noisy actions. The
command’s before/after counts give quick confirmation that the purge succeeded.
Be aware that clearing logs is itself an auditable event that defenders may
notice.
